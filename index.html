        <h1>Welcome to Prithvi's World!</h1>
        <p>Hey! I’m Prithvi, and I’m 11 years old. I love coding, especially in Python, and creating my own games and projects—like a card game I designed called “Killers Mystery.” I’m really into puzzles, problem-solving, and making things that are both fun and challenging. When I’m not coding, I love gaming, building with Legos, and just exploring new ideas. I also have a sweet spot for cookies (who doesn’t?). I like to keep learning and creating, and I’m always excited to see what I can come up with next!</p>
